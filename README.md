# hip-hop-lyrics-analysis

As an avid listener of Hip-Hop music, I have listened to many songs that express the wealth status of the artists. Each artist may mention brand names in fashion and automobiles, such as Versace and Lamborghini. Also, there is a lot of slang in hip hop lyrics related to wealth such as ice (jewelry). I wanted to answer this question to satisfy my curiosity.

This analysis was the first Python project I completed. I had so much fun being able to merge my music interests into a new skill I was working to build out. Now that I am a more experienced data scientist, I would love to revisit this analysis. I hope you find my results as interesting as I did when I completed the analysis.
